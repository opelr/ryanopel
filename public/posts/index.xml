      <description>Until starting my current position, I had been a pretty strict Mac OS user. As one can expect from a job in the public sector however, I quickly had to face the reality of full-time Windows use, which I had successfully avoided since my days as a high school student with a laptop that barely ran Vista. While initially hesitant, I’ve become gradually more accustomed to and fond of the Windows environment – even running Windows 10 as the primary operating system on my desktop at home.</description>

      <description>Following the advice of the wonderful Hadley Wickham, Hillary Parker, and Karl Broman, I took the plunge last year and drafted the first version of my very own R package. Conveniently, my name fits the motif of R-related puns (useRs, etc.), and so opelR was born!
Unlike many R packages you’re used to importing into your scripts, there’s no real unifying theme or problem these functions are trying to solve, except to make my life more convenient.</description>
