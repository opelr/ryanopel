<p>Following the advice of the wonderful <a href="http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/">Hadley Wickham</a>, <a href="https://hilaryparker.com/2014/04/29/writing-an-r-package-from-scratch/">Hillary Parker</a>, and <a href="http://kbroman.org/pkg_primer/">Karl Broman</a>, I took the plunge last year and pushed the first version of my personal R package. Conveniently, my name fits the motif of R-related puns (useRs, etc.), and so <a href="https://github.com/opelr/opelR">opelR</a> was born!</p>
<p>Unlike the most popular packages on CRAN, there’s no unifying theme to the functions included, except that they make my life easier. There are some simple functions, like <code>sem</code> that computes standard error of the mean, and <code>col2num</code>, which facilities use of some <code>openxlsx</code> functions and allows users to call columns by letter index rather than by number.</p>
<p>A function that I’m more pleased with is <code>encode</code>, which utilizes the base <code>rle</code> function to split non-continuous vector of numbers into a nested list.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>encode &lt;- function(x, as.list = FALSE){
  run_lengths &lt;- rle(x - seq_along(x))
  run_lengths$values &lt;- seq_along(run_lengths$values)
  i_rle &lt;- inverse.rle(run_lengths)
  
  if (as.list) {
    return(split(x, i_rle))
  } else{
    return(i_rle)
  }
}

encode(c(1:3, 6, 8:9), as.list = TRUE)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## $`1`
## [1] 1 2 3
## 
## $`2`
## [1] 6
## 
## $`3`
## [1] 8 9</code></pre>
<p>This is particularly useful when working with time-series data, which I frequently do with sleep studies and actigraphy, allowing me to determine the lengths, position, and frequency of continuous sleep bouts.</p>
<p>Currently there are about ten functions in the package, but as Hillary points out in the blog post I linked above, this is more about releasing a minimum viable product than something game-changing. I plan to continue adding to this library as time goes on, and hope that someone out there finds one of these functions useful.</p>
